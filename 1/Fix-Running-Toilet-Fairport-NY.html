<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
