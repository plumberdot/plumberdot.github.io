If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief.

<p>The great news is that it doesn't necessarily require a repair of your entire system if you think your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
