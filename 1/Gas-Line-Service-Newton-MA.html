Which is why picking a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally essential. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol.
