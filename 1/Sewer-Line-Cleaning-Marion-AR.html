<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Marion AR</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
