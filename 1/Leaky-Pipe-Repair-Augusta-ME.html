<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The sewer camera inspection permits you to really see the interior condition of the drain line. It also lets you see the material the drain line is made from.

If there is a break in the line, the camera not just validates the location of the break but enables you to see the nature of the break, also. When planning to connect another sewer into the line, a camera can also be used to visually check the condition of a sewer line.
