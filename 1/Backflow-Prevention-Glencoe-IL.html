<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
