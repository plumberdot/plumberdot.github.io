A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts break, they result in tiny leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
