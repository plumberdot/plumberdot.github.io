Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
