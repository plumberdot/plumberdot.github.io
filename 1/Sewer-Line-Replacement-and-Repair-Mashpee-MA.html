<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth).
