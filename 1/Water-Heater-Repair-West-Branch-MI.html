Leakages can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. You need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration. You should also check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
