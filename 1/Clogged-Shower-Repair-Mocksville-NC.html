Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should also be provided.</p>
<p>All supply of water systems include a number of significant components. The very first major factor is the water need load by the population being serviced.

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
