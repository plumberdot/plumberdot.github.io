<p>When it concerns fixing gas lines leakages, it is necessary to ensure everything remains in perfect working order for both security and performance reasons.

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>One common way for a home's water system to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out tremendously if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply.
