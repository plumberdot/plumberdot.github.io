<p>Our plumber groups intend to keep your house and work locations efficient, functional and comfortable. When it rains, any excess water is expected to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems.

<p>Whether a supply of water is identified "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no adverse results and are, in fact, necessary everyday nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the refreshing taste many people find preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be difficult.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of sources of potential cross contamination: external and internal. Internal sources consist of the abovementioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning tasks, and home appliances such as dish washers, warm water tanks, radiant water heater, etc. External sources consist of water run-off from roofings and parking lots, groundwater, puddles of surface water, hygienic sewer pipelines, other water system pipelines, septic tanks, underground tank and cisterns, irrigation pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, sprinkler system, farming run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost heap, buried or aboveground chemical tank, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow sewers during heavy rains occasions into structure foundations and basements.</p>
