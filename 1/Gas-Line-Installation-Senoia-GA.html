It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
