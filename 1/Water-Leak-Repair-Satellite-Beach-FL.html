<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
