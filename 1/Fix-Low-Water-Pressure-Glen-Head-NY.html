<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a safe and steady  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing.
