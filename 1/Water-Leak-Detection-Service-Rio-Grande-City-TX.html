Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
