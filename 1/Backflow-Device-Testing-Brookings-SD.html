Typically, relining your existing pipes is a much better alternative. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near substantial landscaping, sidewalks, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can cause a good deal of collateral damage (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
