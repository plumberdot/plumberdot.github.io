When searching for a brand-new flapper, your best choice is to attempt and find the exact same flapper that originally featured your existing flush valve. The most convenient method to do that is by looking up your toilet model and selecting the flapper suggested for that model. If you do not know your model number, however, we do provide a comprehensive selection of "will fit" flappers to help you out. Watch the video listed below for more information about the various kinds of flappers available, or check out How To Replace Toilet Flappers for quick tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>

Task well done: You do not want to end up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the task to a qualified plumber makes sure a smooth installation process.</p>
