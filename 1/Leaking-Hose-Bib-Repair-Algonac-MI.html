<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still take place.</p>
