The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
