Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
