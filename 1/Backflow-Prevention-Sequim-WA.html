<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for carrying out yearly forward flow tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, allowing it to stream backwards into city water products.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a bucket below the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
