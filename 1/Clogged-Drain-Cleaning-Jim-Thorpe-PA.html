The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
