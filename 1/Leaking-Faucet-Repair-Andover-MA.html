<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
