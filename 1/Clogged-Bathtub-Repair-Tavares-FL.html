<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. A lot of folks replace their hot water heater due to poor performance, total failure or as a preventive step.

The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
