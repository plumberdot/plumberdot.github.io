<p>Property owners frequently ask if a gas hot water heater or an electric system is more cost-effective. The answer depends on your home. While gas designs are more economical to operate, they do require an existing natural gas line.

Electric varieties are also simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>

Toilet leakages around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
