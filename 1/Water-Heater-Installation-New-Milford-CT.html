<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
