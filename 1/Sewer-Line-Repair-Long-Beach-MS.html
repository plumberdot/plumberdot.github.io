<p>Irrigation backflow devices are developed for installation on potable water lines to safeguard against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of contaminated water into the safe and clean water supply.

<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Long Beach MS</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>With all of these components and more, it's safe to say that running water is a necessity in any home. Since most of the pipes in your house are hidden, it's almost difficult to analyze the condition of your pipes and it is often hard to identify a problem before it's far too late. The good news is, our team is here to offer you a piece of mind.</p>
