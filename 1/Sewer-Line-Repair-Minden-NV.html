<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Natural gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell often associated with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinctive fragrance enables you to smell a potential leak. Constantly leave if you think a leak.</p>
<p>Breathing in leaked gas in an indoor space, such as your house can result in an absence of oxygen in the air and lead to hypoxia. That can, in turn, lead to serious headache, fatigue, decreased vision, short breaths, and even loss of awareness. Keep an eager eye on your gas lines, and call specialists for gas line repair in Richmond at the smallest suspicion.</p>
