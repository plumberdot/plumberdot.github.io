<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being.
