<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system.

Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>

And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

If the motor spins freely, check that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and after that attempt the reset button.
