Water pressure may be or stop working reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
