<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
