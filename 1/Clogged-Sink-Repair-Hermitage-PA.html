<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
