<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
