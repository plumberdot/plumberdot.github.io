<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service.

Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
