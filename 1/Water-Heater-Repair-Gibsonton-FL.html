<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm.
