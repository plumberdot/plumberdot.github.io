<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system.
