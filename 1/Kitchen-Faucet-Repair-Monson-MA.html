The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into scenarios, frequently that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

I 'd love to post some pictures of this. Simply look on line. The problem does exist.</p>
