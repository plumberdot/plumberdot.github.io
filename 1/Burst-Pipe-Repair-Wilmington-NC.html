The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Picture 1). Then eliminate the old handle and lever, slide the new manage into place, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
