Under the sink, place a bucket or pan underneath the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe.

Methane is a naturally happening gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the rotting of organic matters like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking.
