<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce serious drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the concern for regular home plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it results in further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
