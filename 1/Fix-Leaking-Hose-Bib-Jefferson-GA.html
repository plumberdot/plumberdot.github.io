<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
