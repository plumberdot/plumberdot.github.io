<p>Before the repair technician begins the repair procedure, he needs to make sure he has actually evaluated the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to identify any limiting conditions. If the area is considered a restricted area, correct security precautions need to be followed for correct entry. A appropriate and safe  workplace might entail the positioning of security barricades or entry limitations around the work area so the repair professional or the general public around your work area are not hurt. This might impact the service technician's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area.</p>
