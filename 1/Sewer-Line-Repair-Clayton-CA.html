<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Inspect the home's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and readily available for use.
