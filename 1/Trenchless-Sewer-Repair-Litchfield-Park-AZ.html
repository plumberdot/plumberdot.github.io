<p>Even if you aren't doing a total kitchen remodel, many people change out their kitchen sinks since their old one is stained, cracked, or otherwise damaged; or since they simply desire a brand-new kitchen sink setup with more depth, two sections, or a various shape. We will help you avoid the mistakes of inaccurate sink installation, guaranteeing that your brand-new sink fits in the spot you have, all pipes are practical, caulking is tight, and the sink looks and works great.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>You have to spend a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a durable finish and a reliable stopper system. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, however screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to use but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
