<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water supply system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
