<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are understandably more concerned about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they use water from any offered source to attain their goal, however fire department lorries typically carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
