<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age.

If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.
