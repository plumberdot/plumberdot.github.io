<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
