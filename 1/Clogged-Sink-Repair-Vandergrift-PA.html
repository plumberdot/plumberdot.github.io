<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
