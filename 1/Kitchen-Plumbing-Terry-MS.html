<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components.

If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities.
