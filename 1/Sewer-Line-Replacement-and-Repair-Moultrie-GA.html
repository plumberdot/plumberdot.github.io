In truth, you should rarely have a clogged toilet if you are utilizing it properly and if it is functioning correctly. If you are having a toilet that blocks continuously and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing regularly, then it's most likely time for a new toilet.

<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue.

Much of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if using among these products.</p>
