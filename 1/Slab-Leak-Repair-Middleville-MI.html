<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, however its high cost makes it unwise as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, in many cases, consist of phosphates that harm the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>
