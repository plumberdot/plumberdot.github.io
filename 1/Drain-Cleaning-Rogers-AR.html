<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
