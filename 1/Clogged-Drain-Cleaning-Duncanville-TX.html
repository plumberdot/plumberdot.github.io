<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
