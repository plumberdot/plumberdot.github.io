<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you should wait up until after the cycle is completed and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
