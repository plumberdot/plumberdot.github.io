<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
