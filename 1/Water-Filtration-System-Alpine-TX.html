<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
