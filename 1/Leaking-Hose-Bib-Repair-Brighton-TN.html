<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Brighton TN</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
