<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably easy system, despite their value. Most of commercial usage backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your business, where watering meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This ensures that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays disconnected from clean" water.</p>
