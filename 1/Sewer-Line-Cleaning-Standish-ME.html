<h3>Basic Methods for Refrigerant Leak Detection in Standish ME 04084</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
