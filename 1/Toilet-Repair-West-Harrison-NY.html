If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or consistent) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
