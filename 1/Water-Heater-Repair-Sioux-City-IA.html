<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Sioux City IA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
