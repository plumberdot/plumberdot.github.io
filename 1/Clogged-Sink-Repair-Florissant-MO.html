The most typical drain problem we are required is issues with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is slow to drain. Usually, drainage problems are an indication that there is a clog or build-up inside your drains which needs to be cleared out. Our Santa Fe drain cleaning specialists have all of the essential training and tools to clear and check out your drains.</p>
<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to see what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause jams and clogs - think about composting or positioning these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and collect in your drain also. After ending up cooking, consider putting leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
