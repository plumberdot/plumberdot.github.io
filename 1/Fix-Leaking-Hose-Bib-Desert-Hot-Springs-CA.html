<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence used to visually inspect the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to identify the condition of little size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.
