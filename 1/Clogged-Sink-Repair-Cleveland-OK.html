<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail beneath the area to catch water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
