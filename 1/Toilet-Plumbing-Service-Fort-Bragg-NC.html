Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
