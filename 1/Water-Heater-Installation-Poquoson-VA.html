<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.

It's takes full advantage of energy efficiently by pushing the heat in different instructions, and reuses the energy developed numerous times.
