<p>You most likely know something about your drains: they take water from your showers, tubs, and sinks to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working properly that's truly all you need to know about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what type of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.
