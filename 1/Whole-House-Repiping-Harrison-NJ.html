For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Think about going tankless if you are considering setting up a brand-new water heater. Waste disposal unit must use a grounded outlet for power. If you do not have actually one already set up nearby, one can be added for around $120.
