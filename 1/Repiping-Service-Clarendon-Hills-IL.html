<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Clarendon Hills IL</h3>
<p>A backflow preventer stops water inside your pipes from receding to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can infect the water supply. The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for a lot of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can happen.</p>
