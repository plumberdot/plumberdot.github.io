<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
