<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Clayton GA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning properly. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
