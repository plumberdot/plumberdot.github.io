<p>Before the repair specialist begins the repair procedure, he must make certain he has actually evaluated the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any restrictive conditions. If the area is thought about a restricted space, appropriate security precautions should be followed for proper entry.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.

<p>Before our professional service technicians can begin applying their skills and experience, we first need to ensure that the line is properly cleaned up and prepared for our repair work.

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>
