<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
