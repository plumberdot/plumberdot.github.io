<p>Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more affordable. The response depends upon your home. While gas designs are more economical to operate, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical hot water heater is typically lower, but it can be more costly to run. Electric varieties are also simpler to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>

<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of firmness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health.
