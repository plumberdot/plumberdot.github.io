<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Wantagh NY</h3>
<p>The kind of backflow preventer applied in a situation depends on the level of risk and the type of backflow which might occur. However, waste disposal unit that are over ten years old and regularly breaking down will need to be changed. In older units, problems are most likely to return regardless of repair.

<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow.
