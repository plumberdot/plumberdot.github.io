Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
