<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>If you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than typical (or perhaps more than when), this is an indication you might need a toilet repair or replacement. This might be an indication that the system that flushes needs changed, the water jets are just not working to flush the excrement down, or your water pressure is too low. No matter the cause, Vegas Valley Plumbing ought to be called in to have a glimpse at your toilet.</p>
