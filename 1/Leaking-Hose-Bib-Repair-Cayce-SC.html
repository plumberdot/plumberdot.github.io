<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
