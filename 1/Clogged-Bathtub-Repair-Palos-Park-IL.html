<p>E.R. Services understands the value of preserving the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Running out of warm water rapidly is another indication of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
