<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
