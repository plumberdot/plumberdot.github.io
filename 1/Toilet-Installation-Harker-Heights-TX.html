<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Harker Heights Texas</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.
