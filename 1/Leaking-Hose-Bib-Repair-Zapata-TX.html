<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
