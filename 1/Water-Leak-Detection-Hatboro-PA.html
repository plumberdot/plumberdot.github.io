<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals referred to as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're truly proper, a sink waste disposal unit." Whatever you call it, changing one out or setting up a new one is a relatively easy task. The deal with individual mains generally takes one to 2 weeks, and service work normally takes an extra one to 2 weeks, though some may be performed simultaneously on a project.

Depending upon the severity of the circumstance, only one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be eliminated and replaced.
