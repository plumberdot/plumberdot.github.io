<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Jackson Heights NY</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
