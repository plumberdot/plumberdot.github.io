<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is likewise often formed by the rotting of organic matters like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.
