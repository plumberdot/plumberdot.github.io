<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Service in Marstons Mills</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>We use both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping process. Because it is long lasting and durable, copper is the market standard. We will offer you different choices based on your budget and preferences. PEX piping is a new option that is versatile, resistant to rust, and as much as 75 percent less costly than copper piping.</p>
