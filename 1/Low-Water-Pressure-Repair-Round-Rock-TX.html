<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You must also check to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
