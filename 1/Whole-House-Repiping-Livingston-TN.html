As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you ought to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
