<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Services in Newton</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>By itself, natural gas is colorless and odorless. Most utility companies add a sulfur compound to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from. That method, you can easily inform if you have a gas leak.
