<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it.
