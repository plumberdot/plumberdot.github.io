<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
