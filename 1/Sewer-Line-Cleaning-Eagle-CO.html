<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it also.</p>
