<p>Over time, like any other home appliance in your home, your waste disposal unit. might require repairs. A disposal system might clog or start to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, usage.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
