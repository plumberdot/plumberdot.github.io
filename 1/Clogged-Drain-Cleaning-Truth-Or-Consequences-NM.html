<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
