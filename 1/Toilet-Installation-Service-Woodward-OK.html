<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make sure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
