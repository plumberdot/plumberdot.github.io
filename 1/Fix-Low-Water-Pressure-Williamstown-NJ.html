Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system.

Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
