Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
