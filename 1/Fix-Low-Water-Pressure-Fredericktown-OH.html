<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
