<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Old Orchard Beach ME</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>There are other advantages to water softening, as well. It is a well developed technology that has been used in homes for nearly 65 years. The equipment is reliable, effective, and widely readily available, offering consumers with practical features and a selective market.
