<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
