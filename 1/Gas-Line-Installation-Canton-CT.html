<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can create severe drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the concern for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it causes additional damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
