<p>As a locally-owned company, stability and responsibility are extremely important to building a credibility for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

While this may work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same material as other pipes in your home, meaning that problem could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and avoid bigger leaks down the road.</p>
