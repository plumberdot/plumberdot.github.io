<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls as well. Even tree roots can develop major drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for normal house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it causes further damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
