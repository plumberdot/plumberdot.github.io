They drastically lower your water heating costs due to the fact that there is no tank" of water for the system to continuously heat and re-heat all day long. Rather, water is only heated up when you really turn on a hot water fixture. Call Allred's Plumbing & Radiant immediately for help with a gas leak. We serve King County and the higher Eastside area.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it remains in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged.
