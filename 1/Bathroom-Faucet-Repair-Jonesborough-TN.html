<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific procedure, but easy to fix. It utilizes salt to remove smells and minerals discovered in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium.

Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
