<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It is essential to enjoy what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause obstructions and jams - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain too. After finishing cooking, think about pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
