<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Taylorsville KY 40071?</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
