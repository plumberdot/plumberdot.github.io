<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
