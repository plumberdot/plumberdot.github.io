<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair.
