It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
