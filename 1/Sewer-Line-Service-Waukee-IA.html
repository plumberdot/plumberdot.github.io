It can take a DIYer a lot of time to locate and complete basic repairs, so consider that with the cost when attempting to manage the problem on your own. The reason a toilet won't flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause. Employing a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your initial step; a plumber can identify the problem and repair it.</p>
<p>CALL Nicor Gas at 888. Nicor4U (888.642.6748) and emergency responders at 911 once you remain in a safe place, far from the area of the presumed leak. Stay away until emergency workers suggest it is safe to return. If you hear water continuously running in your bathroom or notice water around the base of the toilet, it might be time to hire Ron Steele Plumbing for toilet repair. Whether the tank is leaking water back into the bowl, or the wax ring has established a slow leak at the base of the toilet, you need to have it fixed right away.</p>
