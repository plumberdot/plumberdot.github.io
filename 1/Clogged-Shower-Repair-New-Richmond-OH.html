<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you use PEX, copper, or another material. Since of the way galvanized pipes tend to deteriorate over the years, replacing galvanized pipes in older houses is important. Galvanized pipe is made by coating steel pipe with zinc.
