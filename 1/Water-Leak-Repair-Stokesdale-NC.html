As tough water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger hard water adhere to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are gotten rid of to attach the pipes to the water components, Wood states.
