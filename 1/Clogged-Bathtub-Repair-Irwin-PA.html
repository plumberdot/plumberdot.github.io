Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is advisable. The energy effectiveness of a storage water heater is indicated by its Energy Element (EF).

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
