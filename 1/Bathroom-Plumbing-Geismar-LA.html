<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
