<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
