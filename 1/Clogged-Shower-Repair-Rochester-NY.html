It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations based on water damage.
