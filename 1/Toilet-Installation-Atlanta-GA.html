<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
