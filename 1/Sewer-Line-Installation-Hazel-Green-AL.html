Homes integrated in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, let alone the health threats associated with lead.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>The installation of plumbing systems are overseen by certified public authorities that define the requirements for its style, composition and management, and the training and practices of the plumbers and operators who construct and keep the systems. Having the drain back up or the foul smell of a malfunctioning sewer drain in your home is more than an inconvenience, it makes whatever else stop. When this happens you need a plumbing company that can get there quick. Recognize the complete magnitude of the problem, and fix it fast.</p>
