The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally eliminate momentary firmness in water.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank.

The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances.

The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
