<p>Typically caused by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve may activate intermittently, as well. Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
