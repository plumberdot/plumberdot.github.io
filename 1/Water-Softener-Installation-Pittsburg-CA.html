<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
<p>The Customized Select blending valve enables you to adjust the solidity of the water so you can have your water, your method. Lead pipes, used in the early 1900s, have a life span of 100 years, but they can leach lead into your drinking water, a severe health danger.
