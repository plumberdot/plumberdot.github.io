<p>Roto-Rooter's plumbers are experts in sink repair and are ready to fix your clogged sink or carry out a sink installation to satisfy your needs. There's frequently confusion about whether National Fire Defense Association (NFPA) requirements need backflow preventers on fire protection systems. Let's be clear: they do not. If you have an issue with your garbage disposal or kitchen plumbing, trust the professionals at Patriot Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Inc. and just call 509-662-6262 today for professional kitchen plumbing services in the Wenatchee, WA area.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
