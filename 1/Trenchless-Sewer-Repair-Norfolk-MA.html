<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

It is NOT the very same thing as a Double Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Don't get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI.
