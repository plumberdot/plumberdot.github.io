There are times when our plumber has to eliminate the toilet to unclog the drain properly.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or stained water, it normally represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop in time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure.
