<p>Often brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Alternatively, often a malfunctioning fill valve might activate intermittently, also. Water won't drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.
