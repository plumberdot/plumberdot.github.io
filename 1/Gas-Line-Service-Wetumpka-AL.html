As a clog becomes larger gradually, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes appropriately.

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
