<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Location a container beneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
