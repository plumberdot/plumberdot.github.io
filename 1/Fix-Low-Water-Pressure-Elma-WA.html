<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls.

Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the problem for typical home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned prior to it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is taking place to your home.</p>
