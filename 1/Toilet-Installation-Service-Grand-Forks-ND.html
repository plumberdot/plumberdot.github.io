<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
