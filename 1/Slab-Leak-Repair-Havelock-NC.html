<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Havelock NC</h3>

A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a danger to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
