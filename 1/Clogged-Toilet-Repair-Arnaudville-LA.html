<p>The great news is that it doesn't necessarily need a repair of your whole unit if you presume your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular usage. When these parts break, they lead to small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
