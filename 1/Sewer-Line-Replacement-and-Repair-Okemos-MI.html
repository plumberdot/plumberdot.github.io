<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending upon the product. To keep your home, health, and safety convenience, we use just the best piping: polyethylene.

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you pick need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your yard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
