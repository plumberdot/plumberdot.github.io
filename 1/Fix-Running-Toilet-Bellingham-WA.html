<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Bellingham WA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
