<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>One of the things we specialize in is the bathroom toilet. Many individuals and businesses let the toilet waste water every year with leaking or inefficient models. This is cash and a natural resource running down the drain. Water preservation in the desert is essential and older toilets can use 3.5 gallons of water per flush! Our master professionals will have the ability to restore or replace the toilet the same day in many cases saving you money and time.</p>

We concentrate on doing the job right and as just as possible to prevent problems down the roadway.</p>
