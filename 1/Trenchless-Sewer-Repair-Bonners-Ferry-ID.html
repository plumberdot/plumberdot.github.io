<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We identify what is wrong with your hot water heater, in addition to what maintenance work requires to be performed moving on. Water softeners normally utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from liquified salt chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly flow toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist combat a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The need upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
