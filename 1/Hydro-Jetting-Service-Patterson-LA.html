<p>Surface Area Accelerated Crystallization is an innovation that simulates biomineralization, the mechanism commonly recognized for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by utilizing proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely remove short-lived hardness in water.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.
