Depending upon the scope of work being performed and the kind of building, you might have one or more inspections.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger water pipes to lose pressure.
