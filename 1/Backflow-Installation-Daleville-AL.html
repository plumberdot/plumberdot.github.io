<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids impurities or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Many sprinkling systems already have the proper backflow preventer set up and need just be checked annually. Others might not meet state and local regulations and might need to be replaced with the correct backflow preventer.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-term connection between a public water supply or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
