<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
