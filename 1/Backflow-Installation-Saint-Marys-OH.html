<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Saint Marys OH</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely rare cases where the structure is considered to not pose a risk to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for most fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
