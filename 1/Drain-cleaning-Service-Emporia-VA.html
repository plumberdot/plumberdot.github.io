<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that specific magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in avoiding scale development in difficult water systems. It is really challenging to judge such claims, which are almost never ever based on tests that are well enough explained to allow others to evaluate them and to verify the results.
