<p>A kitchen sink repair is a common problem in many residential homes.

If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was built years prior to that, possibilities are that your house might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates.</p>

For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
