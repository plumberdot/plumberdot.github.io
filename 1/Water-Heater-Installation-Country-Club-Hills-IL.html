Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, consisting of both water supply and drain lines.

Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix.
