<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Fergus Falls MN</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
