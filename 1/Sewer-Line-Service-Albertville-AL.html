<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
