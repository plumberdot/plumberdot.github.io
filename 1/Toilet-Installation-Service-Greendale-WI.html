<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.
