If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
