Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the typical kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer properties are needed to have them. Doug's can assist you locate and identify them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your house or business. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
