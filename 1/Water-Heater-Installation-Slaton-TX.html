<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will establish. In some cases the solution is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to resolve the issue. Other times a more extensive solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.
