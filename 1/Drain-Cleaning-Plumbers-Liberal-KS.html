<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
