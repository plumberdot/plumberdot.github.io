<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
