<p>New designs of garbage disposals might need to be hard-wired into a devoted electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't available in an older home, working with an electrical contractor to include a circuit costs around $150-$ 250. The drain line is clogged: If your kitchen sink obstructions, never utilize chemical drain cleaner! Instead, call a plumber to clear the clog and locate without damaging your waste disposal unit.</p>
