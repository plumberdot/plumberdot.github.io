It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
