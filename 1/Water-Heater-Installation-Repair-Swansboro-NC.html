This does not include the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working effectively due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use more and more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized during regrowth. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
