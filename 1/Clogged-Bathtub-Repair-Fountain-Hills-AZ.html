<p>There's a good possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
