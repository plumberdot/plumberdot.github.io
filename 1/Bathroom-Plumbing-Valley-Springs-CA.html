<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
