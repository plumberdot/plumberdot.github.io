Sediment Accumulation: If you discover weird popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating aspect. Running out of hot water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat.
