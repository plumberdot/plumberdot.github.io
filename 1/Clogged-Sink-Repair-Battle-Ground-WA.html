<h3>Kitchen Sink Leaking in Battle Ground Washington</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
