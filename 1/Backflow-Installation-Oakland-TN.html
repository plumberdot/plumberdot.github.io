<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific contaminants that residents are dealing with and an RO can help reduce those problems. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to consider the age of your system. If your system is getting near ten years old, it's normally not wise to pay for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the price of a brand-new system.
