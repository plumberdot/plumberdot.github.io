<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But discovering the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
