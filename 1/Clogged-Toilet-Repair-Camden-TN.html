If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak.
