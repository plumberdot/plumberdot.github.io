<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Northville MI 48168</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items containing harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
