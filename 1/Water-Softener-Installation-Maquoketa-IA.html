<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
