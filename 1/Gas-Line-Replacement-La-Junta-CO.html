<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies La Junta CO</h3>
<p>The most effective method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Our backflow preventer selection includes hose connection vacuum breakers, climatic vacuum breakers, dual check valves and vented dual check valves. Each backflow preventer is evaluated for performance and efficiency prior to leaving our Cullman, Alabama factory. This commitment to quality has made us among the most trusted names in the industry.</p>
