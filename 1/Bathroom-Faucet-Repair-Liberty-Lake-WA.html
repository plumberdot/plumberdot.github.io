Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
