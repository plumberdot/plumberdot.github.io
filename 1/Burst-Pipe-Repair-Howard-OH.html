<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
