<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts.

If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
