<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
