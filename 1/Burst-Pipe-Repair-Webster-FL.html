<p>Numerous house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or dirty drain concerns. These chemicals are easy to use and inexpensive, but they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short term.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper safety measures if utilizing one of these products.</p>
