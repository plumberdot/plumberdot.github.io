<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation visit. Setting up gas lines can bring a new level of service. As tough water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger hard water adhere to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Tip: Talk to local codes prior to trying to install a waste disposal unit. Some communities have plumbing codes that do not permit disposals since of limitations on sewer capability. They may also need an air gap if the disposal is used with a dishwasher.
