While repairs can fix a leak, it's often much better to purchase a brand-new toilet. A leak can go unnoticed, triggering damage to your subfloor.

Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a really small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low salt" by the Fda.</p>
