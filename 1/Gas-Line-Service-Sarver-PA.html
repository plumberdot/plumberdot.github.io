If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak.
