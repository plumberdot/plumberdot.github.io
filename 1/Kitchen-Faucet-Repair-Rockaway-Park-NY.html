<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Set up 50 gallon electric hot water heater and thermal expansion tank. When your drains are clogged, you will most likely start to discover gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or unusual smells. Drain obstructions are caused by wear and tear or a build-up of things we put down the drain in time and as we understand, they can trigger major plumbing problems.</p>

Another threat in sewer repair jobs is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your safety and health are too crucial to risk in a Do It Yourself sewer project! Prevent these security hazards by hiring a professional plumber.</p>
