<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to get rid of wastewater from websites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the oldest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and changeable segments, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
