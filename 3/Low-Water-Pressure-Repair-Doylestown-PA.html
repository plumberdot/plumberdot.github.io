<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Before our professional specialists can start applying their skills and experience, we first need to ensure that the line is correctly cleaned up and gotten ready for our repair. Our repair processes depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a cautious cleaning.</p>
