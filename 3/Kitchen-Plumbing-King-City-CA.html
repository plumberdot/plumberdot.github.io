Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the everyday expenditures and disappointments incurred by hard water, a water softener is ultimately an investment that will conserve you a considerable quantity of money. The cost of the water softener system is significantly surpassed by the money and energy conserved.</p>
