<p>Leakages are sneaky.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
