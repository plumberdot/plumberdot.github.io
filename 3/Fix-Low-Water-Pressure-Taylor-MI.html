At Hall's Plumbing, we work with Forest, CA property owners whenever they need repiping service or pipe repair.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually end up being worn and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your water heater very quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Typically caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, sometimes a defective fill valve may activate periodically, too. Water will not drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
