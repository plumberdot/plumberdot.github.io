Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
