<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
