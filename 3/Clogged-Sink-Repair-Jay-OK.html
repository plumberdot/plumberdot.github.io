<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The best way to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year.

Our repair procedures rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws caused by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from sticking to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
