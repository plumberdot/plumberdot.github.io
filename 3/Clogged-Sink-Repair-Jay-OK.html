<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then enter the safe and clean water supply.
