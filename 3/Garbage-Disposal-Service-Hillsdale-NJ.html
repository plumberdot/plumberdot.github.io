<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
