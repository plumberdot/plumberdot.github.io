<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system.

Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
