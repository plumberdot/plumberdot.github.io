<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth learning about garbage disposal installation.

<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, replacing a gas or electric water tank with a similar design takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and eliminate your old water heater.
