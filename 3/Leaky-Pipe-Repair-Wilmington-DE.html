<p>Water temperature problems can be repaired by changing the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
