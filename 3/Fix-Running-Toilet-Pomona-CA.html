<p>Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal. As gas leak is one of the most unsafe plumbing problems you can deal with within your house. As a house owner, it is necessary to focus on the indications and ensure your household exists the home until repairs are done. Switch off the gas to the hot water heater by turning the neighboring shutoff valve a quarter turn. When off, the manage should be at a right angle to the pipe. Shut off the main water supply also and drain the lines by opening a faucet on the most affordable floor.</p>
