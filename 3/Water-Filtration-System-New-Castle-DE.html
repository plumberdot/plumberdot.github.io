<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Water supplied by the public utility includes some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead.

A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, finished with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
