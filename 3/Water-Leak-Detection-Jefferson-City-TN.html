<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
