You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
