<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there ought to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
