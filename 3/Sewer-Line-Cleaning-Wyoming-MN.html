<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
