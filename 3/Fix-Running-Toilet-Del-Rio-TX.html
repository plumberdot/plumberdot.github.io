<p>Purchasing a house is a huge financial investment. Knowing if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be helpful when negotiating the sale of a home.

<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
