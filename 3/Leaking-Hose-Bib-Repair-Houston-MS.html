<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's changed properly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
