<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
