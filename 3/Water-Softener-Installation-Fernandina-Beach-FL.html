<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house, this is one of the main and first concerns that you must ask yourself.

If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping.
