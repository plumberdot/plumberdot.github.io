If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
