<p>Another typical misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. There is an absence of scientific evidence supporting this claim, however. Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would protect pipe from rust Scale can be porous or soft and is extremely irregular. When hard-water scale is already present, Corrosion can still occur under conditions that are favorable to the formation of hard-water scale or even.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
