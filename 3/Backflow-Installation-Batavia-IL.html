<p>The old disposal has to be disconnected initially. Garbage disposals are usually connected at the base and so this is where the procedure begins. Some electrical understanding is needed to ensure the wires are disconnected properly. Answer: No! They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hampering water circulation. By setting up a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by conserving the amount of trash that gets sent to landfills and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
