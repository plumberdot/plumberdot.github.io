It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>Once installed, these BPAs undergo periodic and preliminary testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued operational efficiency.
