<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another tip to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
