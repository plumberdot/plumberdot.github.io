<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

Step the height of your old water heater and purchase a new one the very same height so you don't have to change the length of the water, gas or electrical lines.</p>
