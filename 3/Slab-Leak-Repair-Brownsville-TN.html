<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.
