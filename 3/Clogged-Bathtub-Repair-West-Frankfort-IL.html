<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
