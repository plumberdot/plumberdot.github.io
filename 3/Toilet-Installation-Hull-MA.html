<p>As a locally-owned organisation, stability and responsibility are exceptionally essential to building a credibility for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean water supply within a structure these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
