Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you may encounter. The first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Double Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
