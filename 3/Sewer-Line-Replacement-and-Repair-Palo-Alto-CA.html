<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
