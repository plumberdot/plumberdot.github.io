The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).

<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Mukilteo WA</h3>
