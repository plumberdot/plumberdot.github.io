<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
