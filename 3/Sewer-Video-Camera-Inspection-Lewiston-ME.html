<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to fix the issue. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Damage control is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into situations, quite often that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Often, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not safely operate and go into the basement up until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is generally cleaned up. I 'd enjoy to publish some pictures of this. Simply look on line. The problem does exist.</p>
