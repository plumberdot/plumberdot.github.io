<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will establish.

<p>Damage control is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into situations, quite often that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Often, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not safely operate and go into the basement up until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is generally cleaned up. I 'd enjoy to publish some pictures of this. Simply look on line. The problem does exist.</p>
