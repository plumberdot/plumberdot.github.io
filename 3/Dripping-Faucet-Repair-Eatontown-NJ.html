<p>It typically represents rust and mineral buildup if you notice low water pressure or stained water.

<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
