<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
