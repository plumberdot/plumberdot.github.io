This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>This is extremely important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system.
