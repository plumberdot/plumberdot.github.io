<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
