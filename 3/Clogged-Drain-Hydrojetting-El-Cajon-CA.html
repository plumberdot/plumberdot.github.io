<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In El Cajon CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
