<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts down, you might have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major culprits. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can develop severe drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the concern for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
