The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

<p>We are open for company and everybody at Robison Plumbing is following state and nationwide standards to keep our employees and customers safe during this time.

<p>The most typical method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally sodium. Salt will not trigger lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered extremely low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
