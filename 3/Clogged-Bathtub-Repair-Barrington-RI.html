<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

And when the work is completed, you'll see a big enhancement in your house: less clogs, no water damage, lower water bills. The brand-new plumbing needs to be there doing its job for decades.</p>
<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity.

Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
