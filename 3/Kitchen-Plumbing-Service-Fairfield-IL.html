However, difficult water can cause whatever from small annoyances, like spots on dishes or soap residue, to significant problems like a much shorter lifespan for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other vital home appliances. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be an useful financial investment for your home.</p>

You, for that reason, need to use increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected throughout regrowth. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
