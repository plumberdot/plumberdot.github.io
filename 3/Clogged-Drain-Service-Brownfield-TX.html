<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
