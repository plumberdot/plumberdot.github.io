<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

When the process is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
