<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Gary IN</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
