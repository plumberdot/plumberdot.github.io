Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
