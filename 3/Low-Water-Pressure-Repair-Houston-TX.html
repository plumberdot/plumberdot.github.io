<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is provided for functions of getting rid of bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable.

<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid usually will assist remove them. , if you would like to try the gentlest technique possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and security cautions initially!), if that doesn't do the technique.

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
