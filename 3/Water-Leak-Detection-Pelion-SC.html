<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.

The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
