<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
