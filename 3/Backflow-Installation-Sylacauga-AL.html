<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing.
