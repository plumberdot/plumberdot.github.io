<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Because they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
