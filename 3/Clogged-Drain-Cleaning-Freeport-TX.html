<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you need to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
