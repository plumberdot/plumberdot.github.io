There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your home.</p>

In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floors, studs, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the task with insurance claims, lost time, and suits.
