A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger substantial problems and damage-- particularly typical in older homes.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
