<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only flow in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain because they usually contain grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it forms a solid residue and sticks to the pipes, blocking them.
