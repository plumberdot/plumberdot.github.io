<h3>Reverse Osmosis Filter Change Outs in Magnolia Mississippi</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals.
