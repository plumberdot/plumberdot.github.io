<p>Malfunctioning plumbing and components can be more than a nuisance: It can cost you cash in increased water expenses and trigger structural damage to your house. 10 percent of homes nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Repairing those leaks can save you 10 percent on your water costs each year.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a residence is since there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and quite inexpensive to install, so there's no reason not to. Eventually causing a backup when grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow.
