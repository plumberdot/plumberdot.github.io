The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch moisture so that it does not get in the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for performing yearly forward flow tests are in some cases viewed as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to just connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>

The plumbing in the house need to work well or backup can happen, and septic systems might need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal.
