<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
