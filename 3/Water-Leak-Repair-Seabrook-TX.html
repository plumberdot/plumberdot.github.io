It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>

<p>Depending upon your situation, your plumber might use one or a combination of piping material during your house repiping task. Copper is basic due to the fact that it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is hard to install, which indicates greater labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which indicates plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which saves money and time and reduces the threat of joint leaks. PEX likewise resists deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending on your requirements.</p>
<p>Next, slip on the mounting ring and snap ring.
