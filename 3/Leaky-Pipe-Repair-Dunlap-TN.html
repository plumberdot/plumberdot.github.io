Which is why picking a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is exceptionally essential. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat really fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
