<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Wilkes Barre PA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely rare cases where the building is considered to not present a threat to the water supply, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or business, and its capability to function is important. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this might be a sign of a bigger issue, like a tree root invasion or a big clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can normally flush them out, this might be a smaller clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Little obstructions can become huge ones fairly rapidly.</p>
