<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
