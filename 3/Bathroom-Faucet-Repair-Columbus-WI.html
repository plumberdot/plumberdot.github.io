If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
