<h3>Need A Plumber Service Buffalo MO</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
