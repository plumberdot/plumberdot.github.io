<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential clients with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.
