<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Fayetteville NY</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally salt. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered extremely low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
