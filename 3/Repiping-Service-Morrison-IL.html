<h3>Toilet Problems in Morrison Illinois</h2>

Blanc also constructed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
