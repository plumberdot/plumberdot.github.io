<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
