<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait till after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You ought to also examine to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
