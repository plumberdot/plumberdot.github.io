<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing offered exceptional service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not just was he very professional and thorough but he was able to respond to all my concerns concerning the service. I would give 6 stars if I could.

A plumber will insert a specially developed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video to figure out where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
