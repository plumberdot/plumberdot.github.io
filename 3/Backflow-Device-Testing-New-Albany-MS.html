<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a tough task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
