<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
