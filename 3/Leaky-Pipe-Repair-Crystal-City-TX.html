<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
