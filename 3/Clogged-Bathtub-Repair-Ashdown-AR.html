These products gather in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most typical indications that your unit is at the end of its life expectancy, especially if they are causing significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>

So, you'll discover the same problems cropping up once again and again, even though you've had them repaired.
