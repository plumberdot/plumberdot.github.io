Another suggestion to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
