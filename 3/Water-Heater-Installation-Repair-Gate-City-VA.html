<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing also uses drain cleaning innovation to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a durable and outstanding alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and imperfections. The liner is delegated harden in place for several hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. Once the procedure is total, the liner will be gotten rid of and your pipe will be inspected one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
