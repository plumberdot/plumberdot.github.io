<p>Wondering how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a great deal of variables that may come into play, here is how plumbers usually charge for drain snaking. The garbage disposal is clogged or gradually draining.

The average cost of an aluminum garbage disposal varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel waste disposal unit has a typical cost of simply over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously hard to trace, specifically on older properties, so you'll wish to work with somebody who will trace the issue at its root cause.</p>
