<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus offers you an optional Pipe Protection Prepare for only $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your gas home appliances. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This protects the blades so they don't break as quick.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
