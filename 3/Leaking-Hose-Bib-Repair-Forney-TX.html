<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process.

When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
