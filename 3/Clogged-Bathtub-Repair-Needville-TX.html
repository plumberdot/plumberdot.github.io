At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health hazards associated with lead.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
