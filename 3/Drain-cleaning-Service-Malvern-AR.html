<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing company. When looking for a brand-new flapper, your best choice is to try and find the same flapper that originally included your existing flush valve.

If you do not know your model number, however, we do use a substantial selection of "will fit" flappers to help you out. See the video below for more information about the various type of flappers available, or see How To Replace Toilet Flappers for brief tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
