<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is manually controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the service technician to accurately examine conditions and identify the performance of the pipes. The info we glean from the inspection allows us to make an informed choice concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the very best option too. If the pipe needs to be cleaned up of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the perfect recommendation with self-confidence.</p>

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
