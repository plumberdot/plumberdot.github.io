<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
