<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
