<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
