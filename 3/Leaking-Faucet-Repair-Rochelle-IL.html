<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
