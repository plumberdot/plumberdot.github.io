<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Malibu CA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>

Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a faulty fill valve may actuate intermittently, as well. Water won't drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
