<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
