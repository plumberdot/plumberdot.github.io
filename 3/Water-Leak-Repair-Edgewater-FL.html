While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
