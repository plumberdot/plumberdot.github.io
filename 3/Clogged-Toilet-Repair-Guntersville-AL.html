<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

Efficiency and durability are key parts of every hot water heater we offer. That's why homeowners of Centreville, Fairfax, Herndon, Reston, Leesburg, and other parts of Northern Virginia have been using Service Specializeds for hot water heater setups for almost 40 years now.
