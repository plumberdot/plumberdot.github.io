<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Companies in Franklin</h2>

<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
