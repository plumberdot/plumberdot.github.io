<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can assist reduce those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste.

<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to proceed and replace the whole line. Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate alternative to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an alternative.</p>
