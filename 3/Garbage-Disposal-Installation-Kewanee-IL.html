<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
