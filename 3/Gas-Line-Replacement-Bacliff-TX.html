<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
