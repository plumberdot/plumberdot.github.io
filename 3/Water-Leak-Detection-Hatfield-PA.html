A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation.

If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater extremely quickly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
