<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water supply and personal on-site water supply and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of protection for the general public water system system.</p>
<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
