<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Hampstead NC</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in extremely unusual cases where the structure is considered to not posture a risk to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
