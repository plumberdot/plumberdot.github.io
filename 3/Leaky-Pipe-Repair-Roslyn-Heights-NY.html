<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Roslyn Heights NY</h3>
<p>Faulty plumbing and components can be more than an annoyance: It can cost you cash in increased water costs and cause structural damage to your house. 10 percent of homes nationwide have leaks in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Epa.

<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
