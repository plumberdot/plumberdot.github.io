<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
