<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the service is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is needed to fix the issue. Other times a more extensive solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>While the old drain flange might seem in great shape, it is best to replace it with a brand-new fitting at the time of the installation. Our relied on technicians have the skills and experience to diagnose issues in a timely manner. We'll help you choose whether a small repair or complete replacement works best for your house and household. Depend on us for honest suggestions and skilled service.</p>

<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this may be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to safeguard the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>It helps to understand the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand is generally on the bowl behind the seat. Sometimes, the model or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can end up being a trial-and-error process. Even professional plumbers sometimes attempt two or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
