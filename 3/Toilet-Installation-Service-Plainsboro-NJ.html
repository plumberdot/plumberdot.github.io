<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save money. While this may work in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same material as other pipes in your home, meaning that problem might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid larger leaks down the road.</p>

Under the sink, put a pail or pan underneath the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
