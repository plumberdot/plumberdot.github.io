<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that chance.

A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
