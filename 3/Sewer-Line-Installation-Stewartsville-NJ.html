<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Stewartsville NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP).

Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a risk to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
