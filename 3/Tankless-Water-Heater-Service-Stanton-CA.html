<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Ensure to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>

Whether these roots are obstructing your drain or causing pipe damage, let our team help you.

<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
