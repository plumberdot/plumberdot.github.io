<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
