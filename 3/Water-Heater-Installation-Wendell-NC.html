<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
