<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>I can't state enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had an extremely brief amount of time due to closing on a house sale. Each and every single person I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work team. Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and actually cared to help me through this very demanding job. All of the people I encountered were good example for what a well run service company need to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're great.</p>

The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
