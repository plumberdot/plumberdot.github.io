Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections brought on by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and provide a mindful cleaning.</p>
