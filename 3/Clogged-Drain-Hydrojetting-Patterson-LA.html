Our equipment is trenchless-based, and the liner we insert into the sewer line has the ability to pump up in order to apply the epoxy resin. The resin is provided a few hours to fully cure and solidify, and after the sewer pipe line repair process is completed, our clients are provided with a new sewer line that will contribute to the overall quality of the sewer system for many years. Expected to last fifty years or more, these sewer lines are created to be long lasting and efficient, withstanding rust and other typical problems that can plague other pipeline material types.</p>
