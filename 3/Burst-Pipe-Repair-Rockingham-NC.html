<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is utilized to express the strength of the acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up deterioration Carbon dioxide will possibly contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more corrosive.
