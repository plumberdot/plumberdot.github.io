Many basic homeowners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems around your home.</p>
<p>There are numerous causes for obstructions depending on where they happen in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive toilet tissue for the most part. When the toilet tissue collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet instead of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl.
