<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
