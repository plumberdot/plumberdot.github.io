<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
