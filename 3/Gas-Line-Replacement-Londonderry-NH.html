Water softeners typically use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange procedure, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like wet sand.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are among the most typical plumbing concerns plumbers face, and for lots of people, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store.
