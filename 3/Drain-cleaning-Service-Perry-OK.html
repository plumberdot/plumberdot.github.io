Our repair processes depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste buildup can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
