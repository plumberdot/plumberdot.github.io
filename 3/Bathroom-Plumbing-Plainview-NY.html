<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line has to do with 40 years of ages and is showing indications of age throughout, definitely replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable option to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be a choice.</p>
