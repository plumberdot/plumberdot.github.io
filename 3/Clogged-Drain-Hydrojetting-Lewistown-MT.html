<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
