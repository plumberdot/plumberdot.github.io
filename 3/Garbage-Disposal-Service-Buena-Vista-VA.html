Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
