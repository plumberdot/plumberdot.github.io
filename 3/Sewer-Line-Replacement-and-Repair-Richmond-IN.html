<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively easy system, despite their importance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that connects with the watering line within your company, where irrigation meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the motion of water within your system, and avoid any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This ensures that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
