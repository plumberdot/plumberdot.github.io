<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working successfully since difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Lastly, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
