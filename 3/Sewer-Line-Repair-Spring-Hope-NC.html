<p>When used in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with safeguarding people's lives and to a lower level their home. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source readily available to attain that objective.

<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas device should have a gas shutoff valve.

All gas piping setups require an authorization and inspection.</p>
