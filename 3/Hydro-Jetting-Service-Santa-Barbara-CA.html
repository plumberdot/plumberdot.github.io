Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require fewer repairs with time. Sanford & Child plumbing supplies sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. During regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.
