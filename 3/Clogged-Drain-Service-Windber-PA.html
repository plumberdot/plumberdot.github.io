<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging job due to the fact that of the age of your home and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
