<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "difficult" depends on the presence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no unfavorable results and are, in reality, important day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the revitalizing flavor many people find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is said to be tough.</p>
