Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water supply within a building these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.
