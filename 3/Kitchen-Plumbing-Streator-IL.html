<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional switched off the supply of water and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to eliminate the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet component.

<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets.

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.
