<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional switched off the supply of water and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets.

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.
