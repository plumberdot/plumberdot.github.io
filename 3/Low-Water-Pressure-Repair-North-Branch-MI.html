<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to carry out website inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a real or prospective  cross-connection threat on a customer's plumbing system.
