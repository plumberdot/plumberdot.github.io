<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
