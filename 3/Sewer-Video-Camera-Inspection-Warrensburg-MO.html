<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
