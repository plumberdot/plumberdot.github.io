<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
