<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
