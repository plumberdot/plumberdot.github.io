<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
