<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
