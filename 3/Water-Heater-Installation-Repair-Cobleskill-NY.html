<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it normally catches deterioration after about 50 years and requires replacement. Even more contemporary pipes will not last permanently, so watch on plumbing systems that might be reaching the end of their life-span.</p>

<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc developed and developed a smaller sized model that ran on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually maintained at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might be or stop working reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
