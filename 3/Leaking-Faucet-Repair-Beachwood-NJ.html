<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
