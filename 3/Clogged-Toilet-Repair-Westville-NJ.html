It actually isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight equally and might eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
