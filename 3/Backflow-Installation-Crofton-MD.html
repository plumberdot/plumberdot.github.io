The majority of commercial usage backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the watering line within your business, where irrigation satisfies the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

In safe and clean water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic locations with corrosive water contaminants.</p>
