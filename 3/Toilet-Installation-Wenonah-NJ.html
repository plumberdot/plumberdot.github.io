<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed properly (Image 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>

Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
