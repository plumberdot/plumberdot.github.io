<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed properly (Image 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
