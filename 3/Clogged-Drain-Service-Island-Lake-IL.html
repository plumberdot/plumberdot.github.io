<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and obligation are exceptionally crucial to building a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean supply of water within a building these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

For residential property, it is very important for owners to alert the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial property, the District examines using each new tenant. The correction needs to be made before water service is permitted if the current backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the property owner.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink.
