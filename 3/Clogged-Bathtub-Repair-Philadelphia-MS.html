<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
