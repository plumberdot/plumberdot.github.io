<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you pick must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber.
