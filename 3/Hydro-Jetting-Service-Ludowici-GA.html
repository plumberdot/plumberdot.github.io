Throughout regrowth, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a residence is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are simple and quite low-cost to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it stays with the pipe and prevents water flow, eventually triggering a backup. This included with other particles in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>
