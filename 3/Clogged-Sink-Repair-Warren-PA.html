<p>The standard water heater has a tank that is filled with constantly heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use.

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
