<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
