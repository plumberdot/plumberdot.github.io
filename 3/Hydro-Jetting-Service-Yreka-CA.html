<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
