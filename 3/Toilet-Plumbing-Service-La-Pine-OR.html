<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
