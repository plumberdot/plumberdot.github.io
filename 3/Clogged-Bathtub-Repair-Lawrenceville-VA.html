<p>Examine the house's warm water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Request that a brand-new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion.</p>
