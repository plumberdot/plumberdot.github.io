<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
