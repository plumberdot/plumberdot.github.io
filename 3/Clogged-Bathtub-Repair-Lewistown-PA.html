In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floors, studs, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger working with an inferior plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits.

<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
