Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
