<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can create major drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is occurring to your home.</p>
