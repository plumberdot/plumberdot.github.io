<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
