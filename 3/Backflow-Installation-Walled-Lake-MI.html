<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
