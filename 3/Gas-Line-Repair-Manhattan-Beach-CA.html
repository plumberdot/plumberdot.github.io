<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
