<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Kingston OK</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
