<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Bellevue WA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
