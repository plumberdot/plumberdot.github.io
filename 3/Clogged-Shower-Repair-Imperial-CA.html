Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
