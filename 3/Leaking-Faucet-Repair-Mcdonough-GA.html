<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
