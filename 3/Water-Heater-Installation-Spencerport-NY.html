<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
