<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber West Chicago IL</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are effectively kept. Making sure the salt water tank never ever lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise protect the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
