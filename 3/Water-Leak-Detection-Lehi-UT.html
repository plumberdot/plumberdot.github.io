<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
