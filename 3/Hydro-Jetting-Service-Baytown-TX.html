<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>You may be lured to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve money.

Repiping now will offer you peace of mind and prevent bigger leakages down the roadway.</p>
