<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the firmness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
