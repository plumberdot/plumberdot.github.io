<p>The most efficient method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
