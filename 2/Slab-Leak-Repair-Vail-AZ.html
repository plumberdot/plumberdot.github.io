Blanc likewise built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might likewise thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to offer some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.
