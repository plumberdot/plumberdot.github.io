<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions.

Licensing, registration and other tester-specific info is also available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
