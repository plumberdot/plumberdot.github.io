<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>There's an excellent chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away.
