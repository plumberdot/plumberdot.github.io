It is necessary that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
