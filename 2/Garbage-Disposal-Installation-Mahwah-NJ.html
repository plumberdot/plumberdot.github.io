<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
