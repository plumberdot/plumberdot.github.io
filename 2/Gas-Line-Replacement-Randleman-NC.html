Sediment Accumulation: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this might be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component. Running out of hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat.
