<p>It's an excellent idea to have a professional evaluate your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a few times. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to examine your drain system.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
