<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
