Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Lots of home owners install gas lines for gas ranges, heating systems, fireplaces or other gas operable home appliances in the house.

Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
