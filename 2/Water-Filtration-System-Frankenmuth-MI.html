The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
