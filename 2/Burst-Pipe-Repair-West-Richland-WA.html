<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no negative results and are, in fact, vital everyday nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the rejuvenating taste many people discover desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is stated to be hard.</p>
