<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption. The other is to go on and replace the entire line. Absolutely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate choice to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
