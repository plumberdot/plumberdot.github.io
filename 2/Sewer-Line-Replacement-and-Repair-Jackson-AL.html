<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the major offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can develop severe drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it causes additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
