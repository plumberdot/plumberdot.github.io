Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
