<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Wilkes Barre PA</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leakages under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten as required. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as desired.</p>
