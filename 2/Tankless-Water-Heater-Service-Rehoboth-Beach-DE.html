Toilets conserve lives. It might sound insane, but it's true. Correct sanitation in the form of functioning toilets and well-kept sewage systems helps avoid potentially life-threatening diseases from attacking you and your family. In the United States we are incredibly lucky that the majority of us never ever need to worry about catching such diseases, however it is still essential to keep our toilets clean and in good operating condition to avoid the potential for disease to our households - in addition to saving ourselves the basic trouble and high cost of toilet problems left ignored for too long.

<p>Each component of the assembly should be checked to determine what is in need of repair. The field test might not always show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair set are essential. There might be additional test treatments, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can offer data showing the seriousness of the failure that could assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
