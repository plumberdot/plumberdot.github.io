<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Winterville NC</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are correctly kept. Ensuring the brine tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regeneration cycle and help ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
