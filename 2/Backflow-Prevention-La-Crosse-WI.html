<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both.

Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
