This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then get in the potable water supply.

<p>House owners usually give extremely little idea to their garbage disposal until it breaks. It's one of those things that is typically out of sight and out of mind", but you certainly observe it when it begins to cause problems, such as leaking or making irritating noises.
