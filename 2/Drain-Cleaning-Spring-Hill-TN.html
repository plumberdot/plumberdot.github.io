<p>Supply of water by the water company consists of some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead.

<p>Numerous property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their filthy or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are simple to utilize and low-cost, but they harm your pipes and their effects are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to eat away at the clog and with duplicated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe creating weak spots that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
