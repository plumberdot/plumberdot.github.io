<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
