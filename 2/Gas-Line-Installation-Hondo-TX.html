<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
