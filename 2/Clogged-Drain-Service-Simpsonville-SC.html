<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide.

If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
