<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Blackstone MA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
