Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
