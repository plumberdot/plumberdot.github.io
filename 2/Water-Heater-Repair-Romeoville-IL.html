At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in preventing scale development in difficult water systems. It is very tough to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based on tests that are well enough described to permit others to examine them and to validate the results.
