<p>Leaking gas can lead to asphyxiation and harmful explosions.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
