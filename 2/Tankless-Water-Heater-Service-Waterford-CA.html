<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the indications of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floorings, studs, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>

<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Waterford CA</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
