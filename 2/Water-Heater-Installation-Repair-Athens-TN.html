Black iron pipes are long lasting, making them perfect for the transport of both natural and lp gas from the street or the tank to a home. Black iron also has a high heat resistance.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
