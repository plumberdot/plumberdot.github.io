<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
