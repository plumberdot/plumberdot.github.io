In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
