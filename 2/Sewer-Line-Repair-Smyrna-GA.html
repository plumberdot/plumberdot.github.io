<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
