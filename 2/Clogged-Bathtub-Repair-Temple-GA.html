<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and fast rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the unit). Each cycle will release 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of solidity minerals and chloride that you may not desire simply running outside. Not to mention plumbing code might be violated without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>
