<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades.

When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
