<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
