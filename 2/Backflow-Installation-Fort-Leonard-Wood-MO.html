<p>If a gas water heater or an electric unit is more affordable, property owners typically ask. The answer depends upon your home. While gas designs are less costly to operate, they do need an existing gas line. The price of an electrical hot water heater is generally lower, but it can be more expensive to operate.

<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
