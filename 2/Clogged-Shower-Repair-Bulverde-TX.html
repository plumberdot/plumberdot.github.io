<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
