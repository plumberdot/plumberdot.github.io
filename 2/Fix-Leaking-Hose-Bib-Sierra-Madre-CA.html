For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly.

We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
