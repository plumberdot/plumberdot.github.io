For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
