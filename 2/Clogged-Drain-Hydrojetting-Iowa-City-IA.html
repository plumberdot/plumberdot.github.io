<p>One common method for a home's water supply to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out tremendously if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private residences, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from receding out and infecting the general public water system.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
