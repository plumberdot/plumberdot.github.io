<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your choices. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing obstructions. They typically utilize sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to liquify gunky build-up. While effective at eliminating clogs, they might do your plumbing more damage than great. Here are three reasons to avoid pouring these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant contributor to the firmness of Woodbury's water. Due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water evaporates, hardness can appear as an annoyance when water is boiled or dried from a drip. It also disrupts soap and detergent use. People with very soft water can use smaller sized amounts of soap and detergent for washing.</p>
<p>Difficult water stops washing cleaning agents and cosmetic cleansers from working as efficiently. When washing items are used in difficult water - hard water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. Any location where water is contained is vulnerable to clogged drains. Because of the quantity of use they get and all the numerous things that we put down them, your drains are particularly prone to blockages and other clogs. No matter what's blocking your drain, the specialist plumbers at Larry & Sons can clear it with ease.</p>
