<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused option of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.
