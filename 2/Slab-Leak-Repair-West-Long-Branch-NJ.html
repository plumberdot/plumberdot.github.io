The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
