<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.

<p>A typical whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to 5 days, depending upon the size of the home, how many levels it has and the picked pipe product.
