<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Crossett AR</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
