<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
