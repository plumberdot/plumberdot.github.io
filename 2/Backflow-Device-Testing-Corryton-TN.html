<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably simple system, regardless of their significance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your organisation, where irrigation meets the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and prevent any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be brought on by malfunctioning plumbing devices.
