<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily. Water softening can avoid these unfavorable effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers gas a smell frequently associated with rotten eggs. This unique scent permits you to smell a possible leak if it occurs. Always leave if you suspect a leak.</p>
<p>Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components. To prevent rust from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting damaging materials. By having the anode rod examined routinely and changed as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
