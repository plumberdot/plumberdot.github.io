<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while.

If using one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
