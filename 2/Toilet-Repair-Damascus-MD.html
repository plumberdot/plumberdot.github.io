We can finish any essential water softener repairs. We can do that too if a complete water softener replacement need to be essential. Your water quality actually is too essential to take any opportunities with.</p>

<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

As any homeowner will know, clogged drains aren't the only problems that can plague bathroom sinks and faucets.</p>
