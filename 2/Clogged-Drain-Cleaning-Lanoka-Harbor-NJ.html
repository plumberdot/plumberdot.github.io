<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable solution, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
