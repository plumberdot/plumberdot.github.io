<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be effective in preventing scale development in hard water supply. It is extremely difficult to judge such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well adequate described to allow others to evaluate them and to confirm the results.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
