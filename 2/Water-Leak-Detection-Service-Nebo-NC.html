<p>Sinks aren't as basic as they utilized to be. These days, homeowners can choose from a dizzying range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, energy room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is generally a sign of a clog in the plumbing system. If the blockage isn't eliminated, water pressure can develop within the pipe, eventually triggering it to burst.</p>
