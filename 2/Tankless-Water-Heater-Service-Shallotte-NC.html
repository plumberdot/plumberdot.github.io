It actually isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and might ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
