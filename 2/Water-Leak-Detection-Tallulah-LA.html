In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
