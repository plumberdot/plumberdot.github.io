Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
