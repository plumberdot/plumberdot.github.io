Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of houses in my area being repiped and have actually spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't found soon, obviously it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
