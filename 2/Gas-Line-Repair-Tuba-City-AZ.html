<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
