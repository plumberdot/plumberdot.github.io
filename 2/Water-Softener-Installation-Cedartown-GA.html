<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is typically discovered before it causes any substantial damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole enables water to continuously leak out very gradually. Gradually it can result in a considerable construct of water. Leaked water generally stays under your house and saturates into the ground soil. If the home's foundation was not appropriately compressed, this can potentially trigger a cavity.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
