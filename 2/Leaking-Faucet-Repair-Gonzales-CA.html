<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically causes the lawn above it to end up being soggy. You might smell the revolting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!).

Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
