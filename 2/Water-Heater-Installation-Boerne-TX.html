Homes built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, let alone the health risks related to lead.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>The wage range listed here is based upon nationwide averages and consists of all experience levels, from first-year apprentices through to extremely knowledgeable journeypersons. Incomes can differ depending upon the agreement, company, location and cumulative arrangements (if suitable), in addition to national and local economic conditions. Overtime is not consisted of.</p>
