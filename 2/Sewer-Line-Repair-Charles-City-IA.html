<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible service, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
