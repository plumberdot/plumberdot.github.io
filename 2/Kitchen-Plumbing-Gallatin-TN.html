<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
