<h3>Prices For Unclogging And Video Inspection Rocky River OH</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
