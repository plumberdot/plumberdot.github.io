<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
