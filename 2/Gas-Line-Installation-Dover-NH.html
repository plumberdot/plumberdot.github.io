<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw.
