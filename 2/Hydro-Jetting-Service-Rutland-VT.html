Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
