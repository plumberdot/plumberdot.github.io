<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing issues plumbers face, and for lots of people, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop. The only function of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>A variety of organizations, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use certification courses created to train professionals to evaluate backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to become certified.</p>
