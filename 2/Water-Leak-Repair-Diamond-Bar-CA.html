<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and available for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. Demand that a brand-new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
