<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and duty are incredibly important to building a credibility for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water system within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>You may be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save money. While this may work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same product as other pipes in your home, indicating that trouble could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
