<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
