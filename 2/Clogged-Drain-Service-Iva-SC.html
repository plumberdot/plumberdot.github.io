<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's wise to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
