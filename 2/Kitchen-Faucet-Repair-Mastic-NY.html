<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
