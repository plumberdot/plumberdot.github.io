<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat wall mount by correcting it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some clogs.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
