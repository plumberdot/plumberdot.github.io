If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
