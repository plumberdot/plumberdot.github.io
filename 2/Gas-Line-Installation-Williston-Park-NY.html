<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
