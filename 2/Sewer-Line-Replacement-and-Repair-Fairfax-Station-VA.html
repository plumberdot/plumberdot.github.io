If the line has to do with 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout, definitely replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable choice to do simply that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
