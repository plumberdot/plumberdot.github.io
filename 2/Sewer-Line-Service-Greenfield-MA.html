<p>No, you should NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be far more damaging than practical, potentially gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, consisting of both water system and drain lines. Typically, a whole-house repipe is worth the investment in the long run due to the fact that it might deal with the root cause of the persistent plumbing problems in your home.</p>

The typical cost to run a gas line is $355 to $743, whereas complex tasks are $1,000 and up. New gas line installation costs $12 to $25 per linear foot, consisting of labor, products, piping, and permits. Expenses depend upon the distance from the gas supply, intricacy, and type of pipe utilized.</p>
