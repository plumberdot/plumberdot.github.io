<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).
