The majority of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't an excellent idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and might eventually cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
