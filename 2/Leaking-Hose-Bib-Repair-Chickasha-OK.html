<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Chickasha OK</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
