<p>Having your plumbing regularly evaluated is a key part of preventative maintenance. However, many house owners and business owners have an out of sight, out of mind" approach to plumbing and do not evaluate their pipes till there is a pressing concern. Regrettably, this approach enables leaks, tears, and other problems to go unnoticed, allowing them to become worse and even worse as time goes on.</p>
