<p>Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are effectively preserved. Making sure the salt water tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
