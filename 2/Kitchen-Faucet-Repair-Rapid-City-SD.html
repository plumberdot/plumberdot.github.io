<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you notice water reappearing in your sink or shower? This could imply that the water does not have a clear course to do through, probably because of a blocked drain. This is also the very best time to add the cord and plug to your disposal.
