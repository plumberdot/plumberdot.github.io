The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
