<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
