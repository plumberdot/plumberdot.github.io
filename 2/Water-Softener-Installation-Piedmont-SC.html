<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature level is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk defense assembly.</p>

<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly rare cases where the building is considered to not position a threat to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
