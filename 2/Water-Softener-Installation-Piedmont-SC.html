<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Piedmont SC</h3>

A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly rare cases where the building is considered to not position a threat to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
