The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
