<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Soft water is readily available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even throughout regeneration. Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve.
