<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Schenectady</h2>

<p>It normally represents rust and mineral buildup if you see low water pressure or tarnished water. As rust and minerals build up over time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or illness.</p>
