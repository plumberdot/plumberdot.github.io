<p>Turn the manage counterclockwise if it becomes tough to turn; it's likely you have actually experienced a blockage. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain up until you strike resistance once again, then turn the manage backward and forward to work some of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out occasionally to remove debris up until it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this might be an indication that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may start leaking soon. You can check on this by filling a number of five-gallon containers with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a hot water heater replacement.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or illness.</p>
