<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building and construction contractors (or their workers). The secret to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in tough water can cause a bad smell and taste. It removes the mineral content to produce odorless drinking water that tastes great when you include a water softener.</p>
