<p>Weird Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to pass through.

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
