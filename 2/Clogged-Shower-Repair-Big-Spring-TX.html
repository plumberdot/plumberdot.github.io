<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Big Spring TX</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these negative effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers gas an odor frequently related to rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinctive aroma permits you to smell a possible leak. Constantly leave if you presume a leak.</p>
