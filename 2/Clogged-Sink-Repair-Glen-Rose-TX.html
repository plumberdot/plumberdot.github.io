<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are certain pollutants that citizens are handling and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by removing an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these aspects not only dry your skin and hair but also build up in pipes and devices lowering their effectiveness and life span. Your washing dishwasher, water and machine heater are all negatively impacted by hard water. The results of difficult water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothes, the film on your shower door and even your individual look and comfort.</p>
