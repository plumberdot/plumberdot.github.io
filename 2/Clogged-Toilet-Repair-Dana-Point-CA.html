<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic gadgets can be reliable in avoiding scale development in difficult water systems. It is extremely challenging to evaluate such claims, which are practically never ever based upon tests that are well enough explained to enable others to evaluate them and to confirm the outcomes.

<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
