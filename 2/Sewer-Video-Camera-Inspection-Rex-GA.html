<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
