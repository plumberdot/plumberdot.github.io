<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a range of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and rust.

<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor.

The info we glean from the inspection allows us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and advise the best service as well.
