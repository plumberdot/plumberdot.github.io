Typically, if you have several drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and identify the problem so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free.
