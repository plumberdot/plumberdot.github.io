Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
