<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
