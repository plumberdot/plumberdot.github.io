<h3>Water Filtration Systems in Caldwell New Jersey</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller design that operated on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
