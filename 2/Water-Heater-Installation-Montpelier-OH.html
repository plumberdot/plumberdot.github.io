Sediment Accumulation: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Lacking hot water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat.

<p>The sewer camera inspection permits you to in fact see the interior condition of the drain line. It also lets you see the product the drain line is made from.

If there is a break in the line, the camera not only confirms the place of the break but allows you to see the nature of the break, as well. A camera can also be used to aesthetically check the condition of a sewer line when preparing to connect another sewer into the line. It can likewise be used for pre-house sales or whenever the need develops to validate that a sewer is in excellent condition.</p>
