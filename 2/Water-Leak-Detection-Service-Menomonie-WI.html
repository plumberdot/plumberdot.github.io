<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
