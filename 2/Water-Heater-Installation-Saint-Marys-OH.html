<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Saint Marys OH</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Because of the fundamental design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or fixed flow condition might cause nuisance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
