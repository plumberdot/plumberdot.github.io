<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Check the home's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and available for usage.
