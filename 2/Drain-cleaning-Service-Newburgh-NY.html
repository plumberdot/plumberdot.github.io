<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
