<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
