Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
