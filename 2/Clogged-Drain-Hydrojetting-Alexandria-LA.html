<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Alexandria LA</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly maintained. Ensuring the brine tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and aid relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
