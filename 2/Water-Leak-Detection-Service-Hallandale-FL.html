<p>As soon as the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
