<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the option is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to fix the concern. Other times a more substantial option is required: repiping.</p>
<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is provided for purposes of getting rid of bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable. These are definitely concerns for a municipality and its locals however hard water can adversely affect faucets and devices in a house. With the high calcium content of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or hot water heater to breakdown.</p>
