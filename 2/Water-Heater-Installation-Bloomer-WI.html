<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. If the line is about 40 years of ages and is showing signs of age throughout, absolutely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench.
