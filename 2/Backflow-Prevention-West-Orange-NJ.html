<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and personal on-site water system and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections in between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow approaches offer an increased level of protection for the general public water supply system.</p>
