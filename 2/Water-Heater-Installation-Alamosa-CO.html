<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your home or company, and its ability to function is essential. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be an indication of a bigger problem, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog periodically however you can typically flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Little obstructions can develop into big ones fairly rapidly.</p>
