<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Calabasas CA 91302</h3>
<p>If you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak, first consider your alternatives. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be necessary. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better choice. If your sewer lines are below trees, near substantial landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, total sewer excavation can cause a good deal of collateral damage (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
