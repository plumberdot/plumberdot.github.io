<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
