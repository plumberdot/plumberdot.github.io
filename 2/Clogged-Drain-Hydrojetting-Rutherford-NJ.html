<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Rutherford NJ 07070</h3>

As tough water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger difficult water adhere to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

These crystals are microscopic and circulation typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regeneration.</p>
