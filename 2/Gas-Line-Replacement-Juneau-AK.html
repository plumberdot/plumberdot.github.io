<h3>Sewer System Backups in Juneau Alaska</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
