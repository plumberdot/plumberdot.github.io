Repeated usage may mean you experience problems.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firemen by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with securing individuals's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property.

This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as a result imply that the level of protection on the fire defense system may need to be increased to a high danger security level.</p>
