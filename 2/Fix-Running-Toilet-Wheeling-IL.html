<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Wheeling IL 60090</h3>

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Often caused by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Additionally, sometimes a defective fill valve may activate intermittently, too. Water will not drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
