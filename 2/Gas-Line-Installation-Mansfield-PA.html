<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
