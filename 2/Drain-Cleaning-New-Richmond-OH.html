<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair professional knows the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
