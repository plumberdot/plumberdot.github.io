<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
