<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very rare cases where the building is deemed to not pose a risk to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
