<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is one other important element required to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>CareSoft Elite ® is a state-of-the-art water softener, equipped with a high-performance resin that effortlessly lowers the hardest of minerals. With a trademarked chlorine generator, our superior systems also provide an automatic cleaning cycle.
