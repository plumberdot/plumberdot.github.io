<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread exponentially if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health threat if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up.
