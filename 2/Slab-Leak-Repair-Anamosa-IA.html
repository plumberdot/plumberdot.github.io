<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
