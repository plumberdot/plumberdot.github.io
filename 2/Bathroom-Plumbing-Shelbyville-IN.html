Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
