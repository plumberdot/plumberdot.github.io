<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
