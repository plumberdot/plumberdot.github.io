<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Elmont NY</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
