<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Many sprinkling systems currently have the correct backflow preventer installed and need just be evaluated every year. Others may not fulfill state and local regulations and might need to be replaced with the correct backflow preventer.</p>

The problem could spread exponentially if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific homes, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from receding out and contaminating the public supply of water.</p>
