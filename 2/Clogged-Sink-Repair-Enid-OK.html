<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the accumulation of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog becomes larger gradually, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly. You can combat difficult water in numerous ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
