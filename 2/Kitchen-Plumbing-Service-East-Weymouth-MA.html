<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
