<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on security within a building. Plumbing inspections make sure that water supply in structures are linked appropriately, without any cross-connection to contaminate drinkable water systems. Components must be correctly trapped, to prevent sewer gas from escaping into a buildings. Warm water heaters are likewise inspected to make certain that they have actually been set up properly, to prevent an explosion.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
