<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

That's why you must never ever postpone a repair. A professional plumber will be able to precisely locate the source of the leak and suggest the best service. However, if the water heater is beyond repair it might be time to think about installing a brand-new system.</p>
