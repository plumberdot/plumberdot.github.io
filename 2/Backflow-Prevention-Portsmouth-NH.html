Hard water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to utilize more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>

Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
