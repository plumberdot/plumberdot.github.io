<p>You probably know one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bathtubs to a local water treatment center. When drains are working effectively that's actually all you need to understand about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the know-how to identify an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
