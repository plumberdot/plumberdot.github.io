<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
