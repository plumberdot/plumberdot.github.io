<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for locals. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>It prevails for water heaters to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve is part of the system for that specific factor. However while little drips ought to not be cause for concern, homeowners should keep an eye on the water heater leaks. I had a terrific experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe fixed. Tom was professional and friendly. He also finished the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was less costly than I anticipated. I will use Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
