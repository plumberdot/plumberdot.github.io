In other words, taking particular preventative measures and implementing smart practices such as setting up hair guards, just flushing soft, little food particles down your garbage disposal, and never ever using your toilet or drain as a wastebasket can help you avoid most drain blockages and keep your plumbing running efficiently.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
