<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.
