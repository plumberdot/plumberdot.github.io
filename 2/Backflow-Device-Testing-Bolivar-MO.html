<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
