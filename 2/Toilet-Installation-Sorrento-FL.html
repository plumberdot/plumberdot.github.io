<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.

For these others and factors, a water softener can be a helpful financial investment for your home.</p>
