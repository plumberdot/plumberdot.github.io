<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
