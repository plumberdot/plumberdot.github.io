<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for residents. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with most property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the device. Each place where you will have a gas device must have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, anybody who installs gas piping on property not under their ownership must possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations require a license and inspection.</p>
