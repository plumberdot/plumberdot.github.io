<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes coating Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leakages and corrosion within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the within the product and the pipe flowing through it. This repair technique is better for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
