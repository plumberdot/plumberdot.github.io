<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
