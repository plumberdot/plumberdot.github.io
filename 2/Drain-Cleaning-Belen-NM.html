By the method, this is a wonderful system. Our energy expenses are much lower then previously, the air flow is practically undetectable, the air temp within is even, the humidity contstant, and we have actually had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
