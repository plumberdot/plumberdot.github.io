<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
