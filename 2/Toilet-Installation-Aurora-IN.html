Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.
