<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of materials used to construct a garbage disposal system: aluminum and stainless-steel. The typical cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel garbage disposal has an average cost of simply over $150. Sewer pipes can be infamously tough to trace, particularly on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll wish to work with somebody who will trace the issue at its root cause.</p>
<p>You need to invest at least $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a long lasting surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
