<p>If your assembly fails the yearly test, you are responsible for changing the assembly or fixing within 1 month. All replacements need to be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct kind of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see area listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly must fulfill the lead totally free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be ceased until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Re-piping is a process of replacing the water supply pipes in a house or structure. It is a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a process of installing a new water line plumbing system. This process usually consists of getting rid of old readily available pipes and then installing the brand-new plumbing system. Standard repiping projects include installation of all brand-new hot and cold domestic water piping from the water source to all existing components and faucets. Unless specifically included in the proposition, drain replacement and components are not included.</p>
