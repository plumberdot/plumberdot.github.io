<p>You can relax and use your gas piping without any worry when we manage your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas water heaters, electrical hot water heater and tankless hot water heater. Carefully flex the float arm to put additional pressure on the toilet valve. (To adjust a float that does not have an arm, see Photo 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the outcome of a corroded overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve.
