<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of keeping the stability and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is another important element needed to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of great deals of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly must be tested to determine what needs repair.
