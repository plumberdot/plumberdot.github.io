<p>Troubleshooting is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into circumstances, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Often, the basements are so loaded with sewage, I can not securely operate and get in the basement until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is normally cleaned. I 'd love to post some images of this. Simply look on line. The issue does exist.</p>
