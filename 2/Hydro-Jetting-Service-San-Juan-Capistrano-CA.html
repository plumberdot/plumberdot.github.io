It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should likewise be provided.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers offered that you might face. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check".

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water.
