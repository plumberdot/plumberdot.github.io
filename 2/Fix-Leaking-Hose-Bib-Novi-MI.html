<p>Water firmness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is because soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>
