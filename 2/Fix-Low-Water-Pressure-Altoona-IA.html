Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
