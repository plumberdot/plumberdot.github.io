If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
