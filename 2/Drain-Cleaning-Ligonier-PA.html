If your home was developed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was developed decades prior to that, chances are that your home might need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates.</p>
