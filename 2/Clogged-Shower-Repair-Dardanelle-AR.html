The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.

When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
