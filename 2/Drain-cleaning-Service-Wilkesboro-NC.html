<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water flows easily from the sink drain into your bucket, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is likely further down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your house can damage floors, woodworking, and other valuable things such as cabinets. Left ignored, leaking sewer water can cause mold and a lot more major structural damage. Leaking sewer water from your main house drain or house sewer can also cause extensive damage if neglected.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
