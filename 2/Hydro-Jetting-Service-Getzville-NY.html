The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
