<p>A kitchen sink repair is a typical problem in many residential houses. It is one of the most pre-owned plumbing fixture that with time if not looked after could cause a huge problem at the owners expenditure. As seen on the above image, there are numerous parts to a kitchen sink. A kitchen sink repair could be as simple as altering a turned off valve or as complicated as fixing the drain assembly to your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
