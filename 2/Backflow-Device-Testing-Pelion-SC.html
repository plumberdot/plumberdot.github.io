<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Security Plan for just $3.95 a month.

Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals feature this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't wear out as fast.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've talked to a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
