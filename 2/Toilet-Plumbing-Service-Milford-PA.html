From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and prevent any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be brought on by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
