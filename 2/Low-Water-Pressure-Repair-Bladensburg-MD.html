These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

The water is treated but still includes hardness and appropriate contaminant levels according to regulated requirements. A set up backflow preventer (blue device, center) safeguards the general public water system from contamination. Depending upon the brand name and design of your toilet, a brand-new tank can cost about $34-$ 255 from your local house improvement shop to replace the old one.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and minimized pressure zone assemblies.
