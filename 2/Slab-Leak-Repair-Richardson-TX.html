<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
