<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public supply of water and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention methods.

<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's required. Tankless systems particularly make use of an element that heats up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continually heated up as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is right away switched off, the water stops being heated up.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
