<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
