It's an easy repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush deal with out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Photo 1). Then get rid of the old handle and lever, slide the brand-new handle into location, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten by relying on the right (Image 2).</p>
