Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
