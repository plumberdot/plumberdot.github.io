<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain throughout backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the unit). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you might not want just running outside. Not to discuss plumbing code might be broken without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>
