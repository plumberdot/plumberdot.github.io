<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Richmond MI</h3>
<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated up and available for usage. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of rust.</p>
