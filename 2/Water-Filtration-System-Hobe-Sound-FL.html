<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indication of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a relentless sewage smell in your house, it is important that you call a certified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely unsafe and can pose major health risks.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
