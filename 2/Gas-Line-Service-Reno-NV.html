<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
