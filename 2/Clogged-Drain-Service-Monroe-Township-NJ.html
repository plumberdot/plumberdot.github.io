<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener.
