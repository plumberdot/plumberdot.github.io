Tough water leaves water areas on dishes, glasses, and utensils whether you are washing them by hand or in a dishwasher. Soft water looks after this by reducing the minerals in the water.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
