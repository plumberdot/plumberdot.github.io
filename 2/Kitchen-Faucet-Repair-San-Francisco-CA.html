<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
