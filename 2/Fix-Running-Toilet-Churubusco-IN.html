<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, determining. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
