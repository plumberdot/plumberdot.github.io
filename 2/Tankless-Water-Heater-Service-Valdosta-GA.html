<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, state, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being.
