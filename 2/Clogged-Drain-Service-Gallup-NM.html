<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
