<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl).
