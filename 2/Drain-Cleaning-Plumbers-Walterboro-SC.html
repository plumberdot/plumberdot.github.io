<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>To make it basic, homeowners with testable backflow devices are supposed to have them tested by a certified tester annually.
