When a brand-new home is developed, pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
