<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Jacksonville IL 62650</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the within it that prevents water backflow. The system is based upon pressure and needs to be set up a minimum of 6 inches of where the downstream will be. It can be placed on PVC pipes, but is not testable.
